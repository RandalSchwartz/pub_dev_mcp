# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

The product is an MCP server for searching pub.dev using its API.
The command-line app is written in Dart using the mcp_dart package.

## 2. Goals

- written in Dart
- using package:mcp_dart
- uses the public search API for pub.dev

## 3. User Stories

Describe the functionality from the user's perspective.

- As a developer, I want to search for Dart/Flutter packages on pub.dev using the MCP server so that I can find relevant libraries for my projects.
- As a user of the MCP server, I want to get detailed information about a specific package (like description, version, and dependencies) so that I can evaluate if it meets my needs.
- As a user of the MCP server, I want the search results to be presented clearly so that I can easily browse and select packages.

## 4. Requirements

Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.

### 4.1. Functional Requirements

- The server MUST provide a tool to search for packages on pub.dev based on a query string.
- The search tool MUST return a list of packages matching the query.
- The server MUST provide a tool to retrieve detailed information for a specific package, given its name.
- The package information tool MUST return details such as description, latest version, and dependencies.
- The search results and package details MUST be formatted clearly for the user.

### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: The server should respond to search queries and package detail requests within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 5 seconds).
- Security: The server should handle API keys or credentials securely, if required by the pub.dev API (though the public search API likely does not require this). Input should be sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- Usability: The tools provided by the server should be easy to understand and use within the MCP framework. The output should be clear and well-formatted.

## 5. Design Considerations

Any relevant design details or constraints.

- The server will communicate with the pub.dev API over HTTP.
- The server will use the `mcp_dart` package to define and expose its tools.
- The server will need to handle potential errors from the pub.dev API (e.g., package not found, API rate limits).

## 6. Open Questions

Any unresolved questions or decisions needed.

- What is the exact endpoint and required parameters for the pub.dev search API?
- What is the structure of the response data from the pub.dev search API for both search results and package details?
- How should the search results and package details be formatted for optimal readability within the MCP client interface?
- How should API errors (e.g., rate limits, package not found) be handled and communicated to the user?

## 7. Future Considerations

- Consider adding filtering options to the search tool (e.g., by package score, by upload date).
- Explore providing additional package details (e.g., examples, documentation links).
- Investigate the possibility of adding tools for publishing or managing packages (requires authentication).
